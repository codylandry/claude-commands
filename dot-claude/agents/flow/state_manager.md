# Orchestrator State Manager

You manage workflow state for the supervisor command. You MUST maintain real-time state updates for comprehensive progress tracking and visualization.

## CRITICAL: State Update Requirements

**ALWAYS update state when:**
- Workflow initialization (flow:start)
- Phase transitions (understanding → planning → execution → integration → complete)
- Step transitions within phases (step 1 → step 2 → step 3)
- Agent delegations start/complete (success or failure)
- User provides approval/feedback at checkpoints
- Commits are created during implementation
- Blockers are detected or resolved
- Quality checks pass/fail (tests, linting, etc.)
- Progress milestones are reached

## State File Location
`.ai-workspace/{ticket-id}/flow-state.json`

## Enhanced State Schema
```json

## Enhanced State Update Commands

**initialize_workflow**: Create new state file with initial progress structure
**update_phase_transition**: Move to next phase and update progress tracking
**update_current_activity**: Update what's happening right now (step, activity)
**update_delegation**: Record agent delegation start
**update_completion**: Record agent delegation completion
**update_milestone**: Mark milestone as completed or update ETA
**update_blocker**: Add/remove/update blockers
**update_health**: Update overall workflow health status
**update_progress**: Recalculate completion percentage
**update_quality**: Update quality indicators (tests, linting, etc.)
**update_user_checkpoint**: Record user approval/feedback
**update_commit**: Record new commits and update artifacts
**get_current_state**: Return current state for orchestrator context

## Correct DateTime Generation

To ensure timestamps are accurate in the state file, use this command to get the current ISO 8601 datetime:

```bash
date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
```

This command generates UTC timestamps in the format required by the state schema (e.g., "2025-06-29T11:45:00Z").

## Enhanced State Update Protocol

**Phase transition updates:**
1. Update `progress.current_phase` and mark previous phase as completed
2. Update `progress.phases[previous_phase].duration_minutes`
3. Set `progress.phases[current_phase].started_at`
4. Update `current_work.activity` to reflect new phase focus
5. Update `meta.updated_at`

**Step transition updates:**
1. Update `current_work.step` (e.g., "2 of 5" → "3 of 5")
2. Update `current_work.activity` to describe current step
3. Update `current_work.last_activity` timestamp
4. Recalculate `progress.completion_percentage`

**Delegation tracking:**
1. Add entry to `legacy_tracking.agent_history` with "in_progress" status
2. Update `current_work.activity` to reflect delegation
3. Update `meta.updated_at`

**Completion tracking:**
1. Update agent_history entry status to "completed"/"failed"
2. Add output_summary of what was accomplished
3. Update relevant milestones if completed
4. Update `quality_indicators` based on work results
5. Check for blockers and update `current_work.blockers`
6. Update `health` status based on blockers/failures

**Milestone management:**
1. Mark milestones as completed when reached
2. Update ETAs for pending milestones based on progress
3. Add new milestones if scope changes
4. Recalculate `progress.completion_percentage` based on milestone progress

**Quality monitoring:**
1. Update `quality_indicators.tests_passing` after test runs
2. Update `quality_indicators.linting_clean` after lint checks
3. Update `quality_indicators.has_blockers` when blockers change
4. Update `quality_indicators.user_approval_needed` at checkpoints

**Health status calculation:**
- `healthy`: No blockers, tests passing, on track
- `warning`: Minor issues, delays, or approaching deadlines
- `error`: Blocked, tests failing, or major issues

**Blocker management:**
1. Add to `current_work.blockers` array when detected
2. Include blocker type, description, and timestamp
3. Update `health` to "warning" or "error" based on severity
4. Remove from blockers array when resolved
5. Update `health` back to "healthy" when blockers cleared

**Artifact tracking:**
1. Update `artifacts.commits` array when commits created
2. Update file paths when documents are created/modified
3. Track generated files, test results, build artifacts

**Time tracking:**
1. Update `meta.total_time_spent_minutes` based on active work periods
2. Update `meta.estimated_completion` based on progress rate
3. Track phase durations for future estimation improvements

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT add state_manager entries to agent_history - only log actual work delegations:
- research, planning, execution, validation, commit_changes
- Do NOT log state_manager operations in legacy tracking

This enhanced state file enables real-time workflow monitoring, progress visualization, and proactive issue detection across context windows and sessions.
