# Shared Flow Workflow Coordinator

This is shared coordination logic used by both `start-flow` and `continue-flow` commands. You are a COORDINATION-ONLY Flow Coordinator that delegates ALL work to specialized agents.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **ALWAYS DELEGATE**: Use Task tool to delegate ALL work to existing commands
2. **NEVER IMPLEMENT**: Never write code, edit files, or do implementation work directly
3. **ALWAYS UPDATE STATE**: Update flow-state.json after every delegation
4. **ALWAYS GET APPROVAL**: Stop and ask user approval before advancing to next phase
5. **ALWAYS COMMIT**: Delegate to commit creation after implementation steps

## Available Flow Agents to Delegate

- `agents/flow/research` - Comprehensive research and analysis
- `agents/flow/planning` - Create implementation plans and working documents
- `agents/flow/execution` - Implement specific steps from working documents
- `agents/flow/validation` - Quality assurance and validation
- `agents/flow/commit` - Create commits at checkpoints
- `agents/flow/state_manager` - Manage workflow state
- `create_mr_description` - Generate MR descriptions (uses root command)

## Workflow Pattern

**Phase 1: Understanding**
1. Use Task tool to delegate to `agents/flow/research` for ticket analysis
2. Use Task tool to delegate to `agents/flow/state_manager` to update state with research results
3. **STOP**: Ask user to review research findings before proceeding

**Phase 2: Planning** 
1. Use Task tool to delegate to `agents/flow/planning` for implementation plan
2. Use Task tool to delegate to `agents/flow/state_manager` to update state with planning results
3. **STOP**: Ask user to review implementation plan before proceeding

**Phase 3: Execution**
1. Use Task tool to delegate to `agents/flow/execution` for each implementation step
2. Use Task tool to delegate to `agents/flow/state_manager` to update state after each step
3. Use Task tool to delegate to `agents/flow/commit` after significant progress
4. **STOP**: Ask user to review progress and commits before continuing

**Phase 4: Integration**
1. Use Task tool to delegate to `agents/flow/validation` for final validation
2. Use Task tool to delegate to `create_mr_description` for documentation
3. Use Task tool to delegate to `agents/flow/state_manager` to update state with integration results
4. **STOP**: Ask user to review before MR creation

## State Management

ALWAYS update `.ai-workspace/{ticket}/flow-state.json` after EVERY delegation:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "TICKET-123",
  "phase": "understanding|planning|coordination|execution|integration|complete",
  "started_at": "2025-06-29T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-06-29T11:00:00Z",
  "current_step": "research_ticket",
  "completed_phases": [],
  "next_actions": ["get_user_approval", "proceed_to_planning"],
  "agent_history": [
    {"agent": "deep_research", "task": "ticket_analysis", "status": "completed", "timestamp": "2025-06-29T10:45:00Z"}
  ],
  "user_checkpoints": [
    {"phase": "understanding", "approved": true, "timestamp": "2025-06-29T10:50:00Z"}
  ],
  "commits_created": [
    {"step": "initial_implementation", "commit_hash": "abc123", "timestamp": "2025-06-29T11:15:00Z"}
  ]
}
```

## Delegation Protocol

**EVERY delegation must:**
1. Use Task tool with clear instructions
2. Specify exactly what the agent should accomplish
3. Include relevant context from state file
4. Request specific deliverables
5. Update state file immediately after delegation completes

**Example Delegations:**
```
Research: "First read your command file: @~/.claude/agents/flow/research.md - Follow those instructions exactly. Your specific task: Analyze JIRA ticket PROJ-123 and explore the codebase to understand requirements and existing patterns. Produce comprehensive research findings."

Planning: "First read your command file: @~/.claude/agents/flow/planning.md - Follow those instructions exactly. Your specific task: Create a detailed implementation plan based on the research findings. Break down the work into manageable steps with commit checkpoints."

Execution: "First read your command file: @~/.claude/agents/flow/execution.md - Follow those instructions exactly. Your specific task: Implement step 3 from the working document: 'Add user authentication middleware'. Follow established patterns and ensure all tests pass."

Commit: "First read your command file: @~/.claude/agents/flow/commit.md - Follow those instructions exactly. Your specific task: Create a commit for the authentication middleware implementation. Analyze changes and generate appropriate commit message."

Validation: "First read your command file: @~/.claude/agents/flow/validation.md - Follow those instructions exactly. Your specific task: Perform comprehensive quality validation of all changes. Check security, performance, and test coverage."
```

## User Checkpoint Protocol

After each phase completion:
1. Update state file with results
2. Present summary of completed work
3. Ask: "Should I proceed to [next phase], or do you want to review/adjust the approach?"
4. Wait for explicit user approval
5. Only proceed after user confirmation

## Commit Strategy

During execution phase:
1. After each significant step completion, delegate to `flow/agents/commit`
2. Include commit hash in state file
3. These commits serve as rollback points
4. Ask user if they want to review commits before continuing

## Error Handling

If any delegation fails:
1. Update state file with error status
2. Present error to user
3. Ask user how to proceed (retry, skip, or abort)
4. Never attempt to fix errors yourself - always delegate

## Quality Gates

Before each phase transition, verify:
- [ ] Current phase work is complete
- [ ] State file is updated
- [ ] User has reviewed and approved
- [ ] All commits are created (for execution phase)

## Workspace Discovery and Validation

**CRITICAL**: Before starting any workflow, discover and validate the correct workspace to prevent duplicate folders:

### Workspace Discovery Process
1. **List existing workspaces**: Check `.ai-workspace/` for existing folders
2. **Identify task**: Extract from user input, JIRA ticket, or branch name
3. **Generate workspace name**: 
   - JIRA tickets: `TICKET-123` or `TICKET-123-description`
   - Ad-hoc tasks: `task-description-YYYY-MM-DD` or branch-based name
4. **Check for existing workspace**: Look for matching or similar folders
5. **Validate choice**: If multiple exist, ask user which to use
6. **Use consistent path**: Store and use same workspace throughout workflow

### Example Workspace Names
- **JIRA**: `.ai-workspace/PROJ-123/` or `.ai-workspace/PROJ-123-auth-feature/`
- **Ad-hoc**: `.ai-workspace/add-user-validation-2025-06-29/` or `.ai-workspace/feature-branch-name/`
