# Flow Start Command

**Start a new development workflow. Follow these steps exactly:**

## Process

1. **Read Feedback**
   - Read @~/.claude/flow/feedback.md
   - Apply supervision preferences

2. **Discover Workspace**
   - Check .ai-workspace/ for existing folders
   - Ask user for ticket/task if not provided
   - Generate workspace name (TICKET-123 or task-description-YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Create workspace directory if needed

3. **Start Supervisor**
   - Task â†’ agents/flow/supervisor
   - Pass: "Start new workflow for {ticket/task} in workspace {workspace_name}"

**That's it.** The supervisor agent handles everything else following its process diagram.

## Error Handling
- If workspace setup fails: Ask user for different name
- If supervisor delegation fails: Report error, don't attempt direct supervision

Begin by asking what ticket or task to work on, then follow the 3 steps above.
